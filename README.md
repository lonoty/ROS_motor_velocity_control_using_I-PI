# ROS_robot_motor_velocity_control_using_I-PI (Udacity Capstone project)
This ROS packet is a control system that allows the velocity of 2 motor to be controlled concurrently, making it useful for differential drive robots since having a robust control is key for more advanced applications. The project consist in the implementation of a control system class that can use PID or I-PD, set the control update time, tunning parameters (kp,ki,kd) and saturation, making it a very flexible and useful option for many aplications. For each motor the control system will run in separate threads to allow faster response and scalability.
