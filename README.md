# ROS_motor_velocity_control_system (Udacity C++ Nanodegree Capstone project)
This ROS packet is a control system that allows the velocity of 2 motor to be controlled, making it useful for differential drive robots since having a robust control is key for more advanced applications. The project consist in the implementation of a control system class that uses PID, set the control update time, tunning parameters (kp,ki,kd) and saturation, making it a very flexible and useful option for many aplications. To simulate this without using physical componentes we created a simulated motor, that will represent physical motors. 

## How to build
Using ROS (Robotic Operating System) can be a bit complicated if you don't have any previous knowledge of ROS. For Simplicity I will give the procedures of how to create a workspace and install the packet in the workspace (ROS must be previously installed. Here is a helful link for the installation and tutorials of ROS http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
